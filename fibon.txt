'''Detailed Walkthrough with Values Updated:

Start with a = 0 and b = 1:
First iteration (a = 0, b = 1):

We print a, which is 0.
Then, we update a and b using the statement a, b = b, a + b:

a = b → a = 1 (the second Fibonacci number).
b = a + b → b = 0 + 1 = 1 (the third Fibonacci number).
So now:
a = 1
b = 1

Second iteration (a = 1, b = 1):
We print a, which is 1.
We update a and b again:
a = b → a = 1 (the third Fibonacci number).
b = a + b → b = 1 + 1 = 2 (the fourth Fibonacci number).
So now:
a = 1
b = 2

Third iteration (a = 1, b = 2):
We print a, which is 1.
We update a and b again:
a = b → a = 2 (the fourth Fibonacci number).
b = a + b → b = 1 + 2 = 3 (the fifth Fibonacci number).
So now:
a = 2
b = 3


Fourth iteration (a = 2, b = 3):
We print a, which is 2.
We update a and b again:
a = b → a = 3 (the fifth Fibonacci number).
b = a + b → b = 2 + 3 = 5 (the sixth Fibonacci number).
So now:
a = 3
b = 5

Fifth iteration (a = 3, b = 5):
We print a, which is 3.
We update a and b again:
a = b → a = 5 (the sixth Fibonacci number).
b = a + b → b = 3 + 5 = 8 (the seventh Fibonacci number).
So now:
a = 5
b = 8'''
